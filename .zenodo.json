    "description": "<p>Preregistration of the hypotheses and methods of an empirical study before analysis, the sharing of primary research data,  and compliance with data standards such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS),  are considered effective practices to secure progress and to substantiate quality of research. We investigated the current level of adoption of open science practices in neuroimaging and the difficulties that prevent researchers from using them. A PubMed search with the search terms ("fMRI" OR "functional magnetic resonance imaging" OR "functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging") was done to collect email addresses from corresponding authors of scientific articles published between 2010/01/01 and 2020/08/28. An email was sent to 14,690 addresses on 2020/01/12 with an invitation to participate, including a personalized link to the survey. If the recipients did not click the link or did not complete the survey after 14 days, they received a single reminder email. The questionnaire was composed of five building blocks. The Blocks 1-3 focused on three areas of open science practices: data structure, preregistration and data sharing. The fourth block asked about technical expertise with software and the fifth part assessed sociodemographic data. </p>",
