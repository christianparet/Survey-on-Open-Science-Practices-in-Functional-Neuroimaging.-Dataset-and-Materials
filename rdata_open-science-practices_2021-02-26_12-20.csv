I think BIDS is good but there isn't enough incentive to put my data in that format. Some quirks (.tsv versus .csv format) make it less desirable for me to use (I know there are text fields in some studies that use commas, which is why you don't use csv, but it still bugs me). I'm also not really incentivized to upload my data anywhere. I've had to review papers for journals that require raw data to be posted, and it's often in a much worse format than BIDS (usually some weird custom folder structure), so I agree standardized formats are helpful.

We would have to get funding agencies involved and fund education as well as costs of hosting data.
BUT, this is certainly not enough, because in my institution we get a lecture every year on fire, MRI and data safety/privacy, and in the privacy part we are constantly told that no human data should ever leave the clinic.
If we use a hard drive to store human data, then we have to leave it in the clinic and formatting it after use is not sufficient for reuse outside the clinic, we have to give it to data security department to destroy it.
If I ever share something online that is direct human data (imaging for example) then I would incriminate myself and could be fired from my job.
It is possible to share derived data, e.g., some numbers from some regions of interest but nothing that can be reconstructed into an image.
They are very specific about images.

I don't think this can be solved in the current system.
Maybe if the funding agencies insist on sharing and somehow provide a platform and legal cover such that the clinic can accept this a data separate from their concerns then maybe it would be possible.

Don't get me wrong I would like it if everyone would have their data online, there would be so many opportunities and the fears would go away if many many researchers participated and everyone gets used to it.
How to bootstrap this? I don't know."	15	20	5	7		119	18		25	71	8	80	120	59	25	11	8	9	50	681	471		2020-12-01 12:49:04	T	F	20	20	0	0	0.97	8

Consequently, getting answers to questions mostly requires fine-tuning methods, developing new approaches, bringing in other tools, etc. While this creates the risk of biasing results, this risk can easily be minimalized by openness in reporting on a study, e.g. showing that results do not depend on specific parameters and pre-processing steps, that they are selective (or not) for particular structures etc. While preregistrations imposes restriction on exploratory analysis, it also constrains the creativity that is at the basis of progress in science. And it leads to terrible papers, where to much text is spent on explaining the preregistered content and the justifications for deviating from them."	182	26	15	311		36	34		70	194	53	139	74	157	61	33	15	14	122	805	1095		2020-12-03 13:50:19	T	F	20	20	0	0	0.38	0

The actual work others have to do for that request is not easy or trivial. ""Share your data"" sound nice and no one would be against it in principle, but in reality it places a significant extra burden on the authors. Authors have already spent massive resources getting a paper out the door. Adding more burdens on authors by requiring data sharing is a nontrivial decision and has significant costs for the authors, including those in preparing proper documentation. Whether the data will be used by anyone at all, and how long a given repository will last are other questions. In 2006 I shared a full fMRI dataset, and spend an entire week of full time work preparing that data and documenting various scripts and other notes. I don't think a single person has used it and the journal repository disappeared as far as I know. It is always easy to ask other people to spend more money, more time, more resources, when it does not cost anything to you personally. It would be great if all fMRI datasets were available with proper and detailed documentation to everyone, but I don't want to spend more and more, thank you."	32	18	6	38		31	170	6	49	207	101	146	67	7200	68		12	42	106	1033	931		2020-12-04 22:53:56	T	F	20	20	2	1	0.49	2

As a PhD student or postdoc, you often cannot afford this. Back then I didn't know there were platforms like OSF or Aspredicted, where there is no peer review but at least a preregistration that one can refer to.

Transparency is nice, but we seem to be willing to sacrifice part of our creativity through forced standardization. That is a bad idea and will create a less creative science, a problem that is bigger than the one that gets solved. 
We -as a community- are on the wrong track when it comes to open publishing, data sharing, code availability preregistration etc. The basic tenets on which these ideas are founded are idealistic and admirable, but as currently executed this risks creating an unfairer and less creative science, not actually a more equitable and faster advancing one.
Solving these problems piece by piece is the worst possible outcome. only a concerted effort that is lead - and financed(!) by the major national funding agencies can advance this without the side-effects being more important than the original problem.
The way the survey asks its questions makes me think that when it comes to ""open"" science, I agree on almost nothing with the authors of the survey and has me wondering about their biases.

Purely confirmatory studies are only meaningful when there is a strong hypothesis and the goal of the confirmatory study is to confirm this hypothsis. This is the case in 'clinical trials' in which the hypothesis is that the medication (or treatment) is better than no treatment or alternative treatments.
However, in basic science the main goal is to produce novel insights. As of this, purely confirmatory studies are more or less useless and a waste of time and (societal) ressources. One might object, that replication is a fundamental component of solid science. I agree that replication even across resarch groups is fundamentally important. However, there are much better, smarter, time-, and ressource-saving ways to replicate research findings than be pre-registration. The best way is to conduct a new study with several conditions. One condition that is meant to replicate previous findings and another that is meant to producing novel findings.
Hence, I am extremely disappointed by the current pre-registration schemes. It does not solve the problem of poor scientific conduct, but instead wastes a lot of time and ressources. This time and ressources would be much better invested in good education for self-critical research."	22	22	70	44		90	31	16	47	124	39	82	275	88	44	33	14	33	67	1078	771		2020-12-16 20:27:48	T	F	20	20	2	1	0.49	0
